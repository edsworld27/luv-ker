    items: [
      {
        q: "Is Odo soap suitable for sensitive skin?",
        a: "Yes. Odo is free from parabens, phthalates, sulphates and synthetic fragrance — the most common irritants. Many of our customers with eczema, rosacea or hormone-sensitive skin use it daily.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are Odo bars vegan and cruelty-free?",
        a: "100% yes. All Odo products are vegan, never tested on animals, and never contain animal-derived ingredients.",
      },
      {
        q: "What makes Odo different from regular African black soap?",
        a: "Most African black soap on the high street is mass-imported and re-processed in factories overseas. Odo is hand-cut in Accra by Felicia and her team, using raw shea butter and palm kernel oil sourced direct from named Ghanaian co-operatives.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is your soap a different colour or texture each time?",
        a: "Because it is made by hand in small batches. Natural ingredients vary slightly with the harvest. Two bars from the same batch may have different swirls, shades and scents — this is a feature of authenticity, not a flaw.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will Odo dry out my skin?",
        a: "No. Most soaps strip the skin because they are built around sulphates (SLS/SLES). Odo is built on raw shea butter and saponified plant oils that lather richly while feeding the skin barrier.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use Odo on my face?",
        a: "Yes. Odo Face is formulated specifically for facial skin. Odo Body and Odo Hands are also gentle enough for the face if used sparingly. We recommend following with a natural oil or moisturiser.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does Odo help with acne or hyperpigmentation?",
        a: "Many customers report calmer, clearer skin after switching. Cocoa pod ash and plantain skin in Odo Radiance have a long history of supporting even-toned skin in West African beauty rituals. We do not make medical claims.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Odo safe to use during pregnancy?",
        a: "Our formulations are free from parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrance and known endocrine disruptors. We always recommend checking with your midwife or doctor for any product used during pregnancy.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you use palm oil?",
        a: "We use small quantities of cold-pressed palm kernel oil sourced from named Ghanaian co-operatives that practise mixed-species agroforestry. This is an entirely different supply chain to the industrial monoculture palm oil linked to deforestation.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the shelf life of an Odo bar?",
        a: "Unopened, an Odo bar lasts 18 months. Once opened, use within 12 months. Store in a dry, ventilated soap dish to extend its life.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: "Shipping & Orders",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Where do you ship?",
        a: "We ship across the UK, EU, US, Canada and select international destinations. UK shipping is free on orders over £30.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does UK delivery take?",
        a: "Standard UK shipping arrives in 2–4 working days for £4.99. Express next-day shipping is available for £7.90 if ordered before 2pm.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I track my order?",
        a: "When your order ships you will receive a tracking link by email. You can also chat to our assistant in the corner of any page and ask 'track order ' followed by your order number.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I change or cancel my order after placing it?",
        a: "Yes, if it has not yet shipped. Email felicia@luvandker.com within two hours of placing the order and we will update or cancel it.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you ship internationally?",
        a: "Yes. EU shipping starts at £9.99 and arrives in 4–7 working days. US and Canada start at £14.99 and arrive in 5–10 working days. Rest of world is calculated at checkout.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will I be charged customs or import duties?",
        a: "Orders shipped outside the UK may be subject to local customs duties on arrival. These are paid by the recipient and depend on your country.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if my order arrives damaged?",
        a: "Email felicia@luvandker.com within 7 days of delivery with a photo of the damage and we will replace the item free of charge — no return required.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer subscription or auto-replenish?",
        a: "Subscriptions launch later this year. Sign up for the newsletter at the bottom of the page to be the first to know.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: "Returns & Refunds",
    items: [
      {
        q: "What is your returns policy?",
        a: "We offer 30-day returns on unopened, unused products. Email felicia@luvandker.com with your order number to start a return.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I get a refund?",
        a: "Once we receive your returned parcel we refund the original payment method within 5 working days. You will get an email confirmation when the refund is issued.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I return an opened bar I didn't get on with?",
        a: "We can't accept returns of opened bars for hygiene reasons, but we always want to hear if a bar didn't work for you. Email us — in many cases we will send a replacement on us so you can try a different formulation.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are gift cards refundable?",
        a: "Gift cards are not refundable, but they never expire and can be used in part-payment on any order.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: "Gift Cards",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How do digital gift cards work?",
        a: "Choose a denomination, enter the recipient's name and email, optionally add a personal message, and we will deliver a unique code to their inbox within minutes.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do gift cards expire?",
        a: "No. Odo gift cards never expire. Any unused balance stays on the card for next time.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use a gift card across multiple orders?",
        a: "Yes. The remaining balance is automatically saved against your code and can be applied to any future order at checkout.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I check my gift card balance?",
        a: "Visit /redeem and enter your code to see your remaining balance and full redemption history.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    heading: "Sustainability & Sourcing",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Where are Odo products made?",
        a: "Every Odo product is made by hand in Accra, Ghana, by Felicia and her team. We never outsource production overseas.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is your packaging recyclable?",
        a: "Bars ship in 100% compostable paper. Glass dispensers are designed to last a lifetime and refill with compostable sachets. No single-use plastic touches our products.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are your ingredients fair-trade?",
        a: "We pay above-market rates direct to named co-operatives. This is more transparent than many fair-trade certifications, which often involve intermediaries.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do you offset shipping emissions?",
        a: "We consolidate shipments from Accra to the UK by sea where possible, and offset every air-freighted order through verified reforestation projects in northern Ghana.",
