    title: "Phthalates — the invisible fixative",
    body: [
      "Phthalates are a family of chemicals added to fragrances as fixatives. Scent compounds are volatile — they evaporate quickly and break down in light. Phthalates slow that breakdown, meaning a perfume or a soap holds its smell longer on the shelf and on your skin. Diethyl phthalate (DEP) is the most common in personal care.",
      "The problem: phthalates are well-documented endocrine disruptors. They mimic oestrogen and interfere with the body's hormonal signalling. The largest US biomonitoring study (CDC NHANES) detected phthalate metabolites in over 95% of the population. [1]",
      "A landmark 2005 study by Dr. Shanna Swan linked higher prenatal phthalate exposure to reproductive abnormalities in male infants. [2] The European Chemicals Agency has since restricted four of the most harmful phthalates (DEHP, BBP, DBP, DIBP) in consumer products — though many others remain unregulated. [3]",

    title: "Parabens — the preservative that doesn't stay put",
    body: [
      "Parabens (methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben) are cheap, effective preservatives that prevent bacterial growth in cosmetics. They also penetrate the skin readily and have been measured in human breast tissue and urine.",
      "A widely cited review by Darbre and Harvey concluded parabens act as weak xenoestrogens — they bind to oestrogen receptors and may influence hormone-sensitive tissue. While the precise health implications are still debated, the precautionary case for avoiding them is strong, especially in products you use daily. [4]",
    ],
  },
  {
    eyebrow: "Section 03",
    title: "Sulphates (SLS / SLES) — irritation by design",
    body: [
      "Sodium lauryl sulphate and its cousin SLES are surfactants — they create the rich foam consumers associate with ‘clean’. They also strip the skin's natural lipid barrier, leaving it more permeable to other chemicals and prone to irritation, dryness and inflammation.",
      "Repeated SLS exposure has been linked to skin barrier disruption and contact dermatitis, particularly in sensitive skin. [5] We don't use them. Real soap doesn't need them — shea butter and saponified oils produce a creamy lather without the strip.",
    ],
  },
  {
    eyebrow: "Section 04",
    title: "Triclosan — antibacterial overreach",
    body: [
      "Triclosan was added to soaps for decades as an antimicrobial. The FDA banned it from over-the-counter hand soaps in the US in 2016 after concluding manufacturers had failed to demonstrate it was safe or more effective than plain soap. [6]",
      "It's still found in some toothpastes and body washes. It accumulates in human tissue, persists in waterways, and disrupts thyroid hormone signalling in animal studies.",
    ],
  },
  {
    eyebrow: "Section 05",
    title: "The ‘fragrance’ loophole",
    body: [
      "Under most cosmetic regulations, ‘fragrance’ or ‘parfum’ on a label is treated as a trade secret. A single word can legally conceal a blend of dozens — sometimes hundreds — of ingredients. The IFRA transparency list contains over 3,000 chemicals permissible under that umbrella. [8]",
      "Phthalates are most often hidden inside fragrance blends, which is why a product can claim to be ‘phthalate-free’ in body but still contain them inside its scent. We name every essential oil we use, including the supplier and the part of the plant it's pressed from.",
    ],
  },
  {
    eyebrow: "Section 06",
    title: "How much you actually absorb",
    body: [
      "The Environmental Working Group surveyed personal care use and found the average woman uses 12 products containing 168 unique ingredients every day. The average man, 6 products with 85 ingredients. Many of those ingredients have never been tested for long-term safety. [7]",
      "Skin is not a barrier. It is a permeable, living organ that absorbs what you put on it — and what you wash off it sits in waterways and food chains for decades.",
